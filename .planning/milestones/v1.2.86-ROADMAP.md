# Milestone v1.2.86: Release Automation

**Status:** SHIPPED 2026-02-17
**Phases:** 6-6
**Total Plans:** 4

## Overview

This milestone shipped deterministic, non-interactive release automation for GA-AppLocker.
It standardized version bump classification from git history, stabilized operator-facing
release notes formatting, added reproducible tracked-source packaging with integrity
sidecars, and closed requirements traceability for Phase 06.

## Phases

### Phase 6: Build and Release Automation (long term)

**Goal**: Reproducible releases and single-command packaging
**Depends on**: Prior baseline workflows and completed Phase 06 dependencies
**Plans**: 4 plans

Plans:

- [x] 06-01: Build release context and standardized git-based release notes
- [x] 06-02: Create deterministic ZIP packaging and integrity sidecar artifacts
- [x] 06-03: Implement single-command release orchestrator and wire existing entrypoints
- [x] 06-04: Close requirements traceability verification gap

**Details:**
- Focus areas:
  - Standardize release notes generation
  - Include ZIP artifact creation in build pipeline
  - Add version bump helper for manifests and docs
- Success criteria:
  - Release process under 5 minutes end-to-end
  - Version consistency validated before release

## Milestone Summary

**Decimal Phases:**

- None

**Key Decisions:**

- Decision: Use deterministic bump precedence `breaking > feat > fix > patch`.
  Rationale: Keep version classification reproducible for the same commit range.
- Decision: Render release notes from a fixed template and include empty sections as `- None.`.
  Rationale: Guarantee complete operator-facing output with stable section order.
- Decision: Use `git archive --prefix` for packaging.
  Rationale: Ensure deterministic single-root ZIP output from tracked repository content.
- Decision: Keep `tools/Package-Release.ps1` and `Release-Version.ps1` as compatibility wrappers.
  Rationale: Preserve operator workflows while consolidating implementation paths.
- Decision: Use `tools/Invoke-Release.ps1` as the single orchestration path.
  Rationale: Remove divergent release flows and report consistent per-step outcomes.
- Decision: Keep requirement IDs scoped to `REL-01` through `REL-04` and link verification directly to canonical requirement text.
  Rationale: Make traceability auditable without changing release scope.

**Issues Resolved:**

- Consolidated parallel release implementations into one non-interactive orchestrator path.
- Added deterministic tracked-source packaging with integrity sidecars for offline verification.
- Closed the Phase 06 requirements-traceability verification blocker.

**Issues Deferred:**

- Milestone-specific audit file creation was deferred (`/gsd-audit-milestone` not run pre-completion).

**Technical Debt Incurred:**

- Mixed-host command availability (`powershell` vs `pwsh`) still requires environment-aware invocation in release scripts.
