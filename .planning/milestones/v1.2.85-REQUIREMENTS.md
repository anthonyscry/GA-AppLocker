**Archived:** 2026-02-17
**Status:** SHIPPED
**Milestone Scope:** Phase 06 release automation
**Completion:** 4/4 requirements complete

This archive captures final requirement outcomes for shipped milestone `v1.2.85`.

## Final Requirement Status

- [x] **REL-01**: Release context and release notes generation derive from repository history with deterministic version bump precedence `breaking > feat > fix > patch`.
  - Outcome: **Validated**
  - Evidence: `tools/Release/Get-ReleaseContext.ps1`, `tools/Release/Get-ReleaseNotes.ps1`, `tools/templates/release-notes.md.tmpl`, and `06-build-and-release-automation-long-term-01-SUMMARY.md`

- [x] **REL-02**: Release packaging uses tracked-source archiving via `git archive --prefix` and produces a versioned ZIP with a single root folder plus integrity sidecars.
  - Outcome: **Validated**
  - Evidence: `tools/Release/New-ReleasePackage.ps1`, `tools/Release/New-IntegrityArtifacts.ps1`, `tools/Package-Release.ps1`, and `06-build-and-release-automation-long-term-02-SUMMARY.md`

- [x] **REL-03**: Release execution provides a single non-interactive orchestration path that runs release steps end-to-end and reports per-step pass/fail outcomes.
  - Outcome: **Validated**
  - Evidence: `tools/Invoke-Release.ps1`, `build.ps1`, `Release-Version.ps1`, and `06-build-and-release-automation-long-term-03-SUMMARY.md`

- [x] **REL-04**: Release-note output and entrypoint compatibility remain stable for operators, including fixed section templates with empty-section fallback `- None.`, compatibility wrappers, and manifest version normalization.
  - Outcome: **Validated**
  - Evidence: `tools/templates/release-notes.md.tmpl`, compatibility wrapper updates, manifest version helper, and `06-build-and-release-automation-long-term-03-SUMMARY.md`
