# GA-AppLocker Planning Workspace

## Current State

- Shipped version: `v1.2.86` (Release Automation) on 2026-02-17.
- Milestone scope completed: Phase 6 (`06-build-and-release-automation-long-term`), 4 plans, 10 tasks.
- Release workflow now uses deterministic context/notes/packaging/integrity orchestration through a single non-interactive path.
- Milestone artifacts are archived in `.planning/milestones/`.

## Next Milestone Goals

- Run `/gsd-new-milestone` to define the next milestone through questioning, research, requirements, and roadmap planning.
- Recreate a fresh `.planning/REQUIREMENTS.md` for the next milestone scope.
- Optionally run `/gsd-audit-milestone` retroactively for `v1.2.86` to produce a formal audit record.
